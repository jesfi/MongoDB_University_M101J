QUESTION 2

Please use the Enron dataset you imported for the previous problem. For this question you will use the aggregation framework to figure out pairs of people that tend to communicate a lot. To do this, you will need to unwind the To list for each message.

This problem is a little tricky because a recipient may appear more than once in the To list for a message. You will need to fix that in a stage of the aggregation before doing your grouping and counting of (sender, recipient) pairs.

Which pair of people have the greatest number of messages in the dataset

Answer:
db.messages.aggregate([
{$project:{"headers.From":1,"headers.To":1}},
{$unwind:"$headers.To"},
{$group:{"_id":{"id":"$_id","From":"$headers.From"},To:{$addToSet:"$headers.To"}}},
{$unwind:"$To"},
{$group:{"_id":{"From":"$_id.From","To":"$To"},count:{$sum:1}}},
{$sort:{"count":-1}}
],
{ allowDiskUse: true })

/* 1 */
{
    "_id" : {
        "From" : "susan.mara@enron.com",
        "To" : "jeff.dasovich@enron.com"
    },
    "count" : 750.0
}
